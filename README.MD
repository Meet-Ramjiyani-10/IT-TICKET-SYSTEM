# IT Incident SLA Prediction System

## Overview
This project implements an ML-based SLA breach risk prediction system
using incident management data. The system predicts the probability
of SLA breach at ticket creation time to enable proactive intervention.

## ML Scope (v1)
- Incident-level dataset derived from event logs
- SLA breach prediction (Logistic Regression)
- Recall-optimized decision threshold

## API
See `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`

## Notes
This project combines rule-based logic with ML where appropriate,
prioritizing interpretability and operational realism.
